    "In this assignment you will solve a data science problem end-to-end, pretending to be recently hired data scientists in a company. To help you get started, we've prepared a checklist to guide you through the project. Here are the main steps that you will go through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Frame the problem and look at the big picture\n",
    "2. Get the data\n",
    "3. Explore and visualise the data to gain insights\n",
    "4. Prepare the data to better expose the underlying data patterns to machine learning algorithms\n",
    "5. Explore many different models and short-list the best ones\n",
    "6. Fine-tune your models\n",
    "7. Present your solution (video presentation) \n",
    "\n",
    "In each step we list a set of questions that one should have in mind when undertaking a data science project. The list is not meant to be exhaustive, but does contain a selection of the most important questions to ask. We will be available to provide assistance with each of the steps, and will allocate some part of each lesson towards working on the projects.\n",

    "2. Feature selection (optional):\n",
    "    * Drop the features that provide no useful information for the task (e.g. a customer ID is usually useless for modelling).\n",
    "3. Feature engineering, where appropriate:\n",
    "    * Discretize continuous features\n",
    "    * Use one-hot encoding if/when relevant\n",
    "    * Add promising transformations of features (e.g. $\\log(x)$, $\\sqrt{x}$, $x^2$, etc)\n",
    "    * Aggregate features into promising new features\n",
    "4. Feature scaling: standardise or normalise features"
